# iTunes Apple Music Databse Search Web App

## Search the Apple Music database for the musical work of any artist.

This web app was built with the sole purpose of practicing my Javascript skills.

I wanted to build an app that uses the Fetch API within Javascript to pull from a public endpoint. This app does just that, and mimics the styling of the Apple Music website page at the time of creation.

# Features

Type the name of any artist in the search bar, and their discography will populate on the left side of the window.

# Responsive

This app is compatible with screen sizes of any size.

# Caveats

Since this app pulls from various endpoints, it needs to be hosted on a trusted server, such as localhost, to pull data. This is due to CORS request security. **This app will not run natively off a file system**.

# What I'd Like to Fix in the Future

While this app is compatible with small screens, it was not designed mobile first. Since creating this app, I've been designing web pages mobile first which cuts down on unnecessary media queries. If I were to come back to this in the future, I'd overhaul the design to cut down on code and have it be even more responsive.

## Feel free to clone this repository and fix/improve it as you see fit.
